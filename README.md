# Core Banking Operations Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for analyzing core banking processes, including account management, deposits, withdrawals, and customer activity. The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data modeling and transformation to creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard.

## Project Overview
As a data analyst, my goal was to provide data-driven insights to help bank managers monitor operational health and make informed decisions. The dashboard addresses key questions about customer activity, financial trends, and the status of the bank's account portfolio.

## Key Features & Visualizations
The interactive dashboard is organized into several sections for a clear overview of core banking data.

Bank Performance Overview: Key performance indicators (KPIs) showing the total number of active customers, overall transaction volume, and the current total balance.

Transaction Analysis: A line chart visualizing the trends of deposits vs. withdrawals over time, highlighting key periods of cash inflow and outflow.

Delinquent Account Monitoring: A card and table visualization to identify and list accounts with negative balances or overdue payments, allowing for proactive risk management.

Customer Activity by Age Group: A bar chart showing a breakdown of customer transactions across different age groups, revealing demographic trends in banking behavior.

Account Distribution by Type: A donut chart illustrating the ratio of different account types (e.g., Savings, Checking), providing insight into the most popular banking products.
